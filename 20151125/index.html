				ear Mike !
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I would like to thanks you a thousand times for agreeing us to meet each other and then offer your friendship to Kenji ! He was also pleased to meet you as I.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, let me present myself and  family, my name is Ken PHAN, born in 1965 (50yo), without job, Kenji's mother, Joy SOK born in 1972 (43yo), hairdresser, and Kenji PHAN born in august 2004, grade 6 at Basilica ST PAUL, Daytona Beach FLORIDA. We came from FRANCE and actually, we're living at my stepbrother's house, elder to my wife, at DAYTONA BEACH.

				Kenji began to touch his first putter at 6 month, and when he began to walk his first steps, I bought him two Iron 7 one lefty, one righty... Why ? Because I noticed that Kenji took them with the left hand, I guessed a little that he would play south paw and indeed, when we laid the two Iron 7 side by side, he took the lefty one, and since then, I let him play his natural style, and Kenji is still going on playing golf south paw "only for playing golf" for doing other things, he uses his right hand.

				Kenji discovered GOLF with us, I'm a very bad player, when we went to the practice, we often brought Kenji who liked to play with my wood 5 right handed, but he swang with his left hand. Some time later, I get to Chine for my business in decoration, and meanwhile, Kenji's mother brought him to a GOLF school, he learned to swing with a coach but didn't liked that much than playing with us. I stayed in China for about 3 years, but I didn't managed to increase my business, I almost lost everything, but I didn't lost hope and got back to France, and at this time, I noticed Kenji had a gift or something greater for golf, and I decided to leave everything, leaving all business and take care of Kenji intensively. When Kenji was about 6 years old and a half, Kenji stopped taking golf lessons, he trained with me, we often watched golf pro tournaments on television or computer and also with books about golf, this was how Kenji learned golf by himself and with a father who doesn't know a lot about golf. A year and a half later, I met an american pro golf player who lived in Biarritz, south-west of France. I sometimes bring Kenji to him with the aim of teaching pro swings, but most of the time, he likes to practice by himself.

				Mike, I have a favor to ask to you, could you find some sponsors for Kenji, he's a kid born to be a golfer, he has a gift from heaven, believe me, Mike, Kenji could be a great golf player in the future, with your help, you could bring him to the path to legend "A great Champion can't manage with a great coach, idn't it Mike ?" Why do I dare ask you to help Kenji ? It's because I believe that "he has the game in his hands, a strong mind with feeling, creativity end ready to learn", he's an 11 years old boy with an objective, and knows what he wants to become, by his teenage years, he, himself, asked me to bring him to the United States.<br>
				Mike, he doesn't like golf, he's passionated by golf and stories about golf, all great legends like old Tom Morris, Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Sam Snead...<br>
				The one he admire the most among all the great golfers is Mr Ben Hogan. He admire his courage after his car accident in 1948 to get back with a shaky leg with the determination to rebuild a new swing and managed to win three majors the same year in 1958, The Master, the US Open and the open Championship.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike, why do I ask you to find a sponsor for Kenji, I don't want to abuse of you or anything this kind, it's because we can't afford pay out a couch for our son, to pay for school, Kenji is sponsored by St Paul School which provided administrative documents for a five years F1 Visa, that's why Kenji managed to get here. Mike, you're the only one who can take this decision. If you agreed to take Kenji as your pupil, it's for love, not for money.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll stop my pen here.
				Love
			</p>
			<p>
				Kenji,Joy & Ken
